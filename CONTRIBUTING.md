# Contribution Guidelines
Any & all change suggestions are welcome and will be considered to the best of our ability.  If you would like to help but are not sure where to start, simply [create an issue](https://github.com/aldefouw/redcap_cypress_docker/issues/new) describing what you'd like to help with, and where you're getting stuck in the [documentation on this repo](README.md) or any of the related repos.  Please don't hesitate to ask if something is unclear.  Fresh perspectices are crucial for identifying gaps in our documentation and helping clarify things that are not obvious to those just getting started.  

Contributions are shared via a standard [GitHub pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests).  The documentation at that link covers all the basic concepts very well when it comes to using GitHub to create a pull request.  If you have further questions on the basics, there is no shortage of other tutorials (including videos) to be found for git, GitHub, forks, commits, pull requests, or any other related topics.  Partial pull requests (with placeholders, pseudocode, etc.) are also welcome if you have an idea but are not sure how to fully implement it.

Community discussion related to automated testing also takes place in the [REDCap Community Support Forum](https://redcap.vanderbilt.edu/community/) (consortium member access required).
